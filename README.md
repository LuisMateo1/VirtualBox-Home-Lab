# VBox-Home-Lab

<h>Creating a Home Lab using VirtualBox</h>

In this lab, I will create two virtual machines using VirtualBox, and configure the network settings to allow those two machines to communicate with each other only, and not connect to the internet.

After downloading all the necessary files I checked the file hashes and confirmed it matched the checksum on the website to make sure the file was not changed in transit.

While unnecessary in this case, it's a good practice to check file hashes to confirm the integrity of a file
